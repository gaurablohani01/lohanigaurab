                                <p>Charlene Thompson reached for her phone on the nightstand. It was still before 6:00 am, so the iPhone's glow was the only light in the room. Her husband, James, turned over and groaned.</p>

                                <p>'That's a horrible habit,' he said. 'You should always have coffee before checking your inbox.'</p>

                                <p>'This is important, honey,' she whispered. 'I need to see what's happening with the contest.'</p>

                                <p>Charlene was the head of public relations for Canadian Jet. Yesterday, with the help of the company's PR firm, Wrigley & Walters, the airline had launched its first Twitter contest. The person who posted the most creative tweet using the hashtag #CanJetLuxury would win two round-trip tickets to any of the company's destinations.</p>

                                <p>For Charlene, who had led the airline's communications for 15 years, this campaign was critical. Six months before, a third of Canadian Jet's fleet had been grounded for a week owing to some engine safety concerns, causing a slew of cancellations and delays. There had also been some negative press about the airline's approach to labor relations following a threatened strike by the ground crews. The team at Wrigley & Walters had designed this campaign to restore Canadian Jet's image as a preferred carrier.</p>

                                <p>'Shoot. This isn't good,' Charlene said as she scrolled through an endless string of tweets.</p>

                                <p>'What? It's not catching on?' James asked groggily.</p>

                                <p>Just the opposite. But not in a good way. 'She read a few of the tweets: 'Getting to my destination without the engine catching fire #CanJetLuxury'; 'Being stranded 3,000 miles from my family for two days straight #CanJetLuxury'; '#CanJetLuxury is getting away with not paying employees fairly.'</p>

                                <p>'Ouch,' James said.</p>

                                <p>'This is completely backfiring,' Charlene thought as she got out of bed.</p>

                                <p>'Where are you going?' he asked.</p>

                                <p>'I need to call Jerry.'</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">As one of the first to enter the field of office automation, Infotech Software, Inc. had built a reputation for designing high-quality and user-friendly database and accounting programs for business and industry. When they decided to enter the word-processing market, their engineers designed an effective, versatile, and powerful program that Infotech felt sure would outperform any competitors.</p>
                            
                            <p>To be sure that their new word-processing program was accurately documented, Infotech asked the senior program designer to supervise writing the instruction manual. The result was a thorough, accurate and precise description of every detail of the program's operation.</p>
                            
                            <p>When Infotech began marketing its new word processor, cries for help flooded in from office workers who were so confused by the massive manual that they couldn't even find out how to get started. Then several business journals reviewed the program and judged it "too complicated" and "difficult to learn." After an impressive start, sales of the new word processing program plummeted.</p>
                            
                            <p>Infotech eventually put out a new, clearly written training guide that led new users step by step through introductory exercises and told them how to find commands quickly. But the rewrite cost Infotech $445,000/-, a year's lead in the market, and its reputation for producing easy-to-use business software.</p>

                            <p>a. What was the goal of the communication in this case? Why do you think the communicator could not clearly communicate its goal?</p>
                            <p>b. What common communication errors can take place while communicating professionally such as in this case?</p>
                            <p>c. In the light of this case, what costs/losses do you think a company / an organization has to incur due to the ineffective communication?</p>
                            <p>d. If you were the communicator writing this manual, what cautions would you take to avoid the situation Infotech Software faced?</p>
