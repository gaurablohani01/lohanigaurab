                            <p><strong>Read the following case carefully and answer the questions that follow:</strong></p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">TechNova Solutions, a mid-sized tech company, had been experiencing financial strain after a series of underperforming product launches. To address the increasing expenditure, the CEO decided cost-cutting was essential. Since a large portion of the company's budget was tied to human resources, the leadership decided to downsize staff. A clear target was the AI Research Unit—a team focused on experimental projects that had recently shown minimal output and was utilizing significant resources.</p>
                            
                            <p>This unit, located in the R&D building's third floor, had been working on prototype-level innovations that hadn't progressed beyond theoretical development. Most of their projects could be absorbed into other departments, and closing this unit promised major cost savings. The team of about thirty-five researchers and engineers reported to Dr. Nina Kapoor, the lead scientist. As the unit was to be shut down, Nina's position would also be dissolved.</p>
                            
                            <p>However, several key issues complicated the process. First, the company had a "redeployment-first" policy rather than layoffs. This meant HR was responsible for placing AI unit members in other open roles where feasible. While some roles were available, it was uncertain how many would match their qualifications. Second, the AI team had a reputation for being inflexible and siloed. Other departments saw them as resistant to collaboration and change, with quality and productivity often called into question. Nina herself was widely viewed as technically brilliant but ineffective as a leader. Hence, other managers were hesitant to accept reassigned staff from the unit.</p>
                            
                            <p>Several high-level meetings were held involving department heads, the director of HR, the internal communications manager, and a labor consultant to plan the closure. Initially, the leadership debated whether Nina should be involved in these meetings, eventually deciding her inclusion would be politically more appropriate. Throughout the meetings, Nina reacted emotionally, often crying, which made discussions awkward. All participants were told to maintain strict confidentiality until the public plan was finalized. Still, rumors rapidly began to circulate that the AI unit was being dissolved.</p>
                            
                            <p>Eventually, a strategy was outlined. On Tuesday morning, the HR director and a senior VP would meet with AI unit staff to inform them. Staff with redeployment offers would be told about new roles; others would be offered an enhanced severance package. Following that, a company-wide memo would be released, and team-specific meetings would occur later that day to clarify the news. A press release would be sent to external stakeholders in the afternoon.</p>
                            
                            <p>On Sunday evening, two days before the announcement, the planning team met with the CTO, Mr. Rajiv Jain, and the COO, Ms. Tanya Rao, to present the finalized plan. To the group's surprise, both executives objected strongly. They demanded exact numbers of layoffs and redeployments, but the team couldn't give definite figures due to constantly shifting internal vacancies. Furthermore, Ms. Rao rejected the idea of the company-wide letter being signed by the CEO, insisting the communication must not give the impression that leadership was avoiding accountability. They halted the plan until revisions were made.</p>
                            
                            <p>Meanwhile, word had already spread internally. The AI unit staff suspected the closure and began rallying support. One team member sent an internal message across the company's Slack workspace:</p>
                            
                            <p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 2rem;">"We are long-time innovators now facing termination without fair warning. We're starting a support fund for our affected colleagues. Contributions welcome."</p>
                            
                            <p>On Tuesday, AI unit employees arrived in black attire, wearing symbolic circuit-themed armbands. Screensavers in the lab displayed "Innovation Deserved Better." Confused coworkers and visiting clients noticed the somber mood. When no official communication came, tensions grew. On Wednesday, frustration turned emotional. One employee broke down, and soon others followed suit. HR was contacted, and the director arrived to find a team in collective distress. She instructed everyone to go home while she worked with the CTO to rapidly reassign ongoing projects.</p>
                            
                            <p>On Thursday, TechNova officially announced the closure of the AI Research Unit.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
                            <p>a. What were the reasons for the spreading of rumors regarding the layoffs of the observation ward staff (AI unit in new context)?</p>
                            <p>b. What does the organization's situation suggest about the importance of communication at all levels?</p>
                            <p>c. Ideally, how should this situation have been handled without probably losing the organization's reputation?</p>
                            <p>d. Can Artificial Intelligence ever replicate or replace Emotional Intelligence in human interaction? Discuss.</p>
